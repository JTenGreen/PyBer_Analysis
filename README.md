As a result of Urban cities having a higher population this translates to more available drivers to meet the demand which leads to a lower Average fare per ride, this becomes the oposite when we look at rural cities which have less drivers to meet the demand and this causes a higher average fare per ride and in the midle are suburban cities in regards to drivers and average fare price.

Summary:

When viewing the chart we can see that suburban cities are generally the most stable in regards to fares with a spike during the end of April which should be further investigated to see what caused the spike.
Upon further examination of rural citites there is a higher demand than supply in these citites which could benefit from additional drivers to meet demand and increase profits.
